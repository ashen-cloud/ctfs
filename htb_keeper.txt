	22 and 80 open

	the page is running request tracker 4.4.4
	default credentials of root password get us in
	googling just to see if this version has any easy vulnerabilities, and apparently it doesn't

	after looking around, in the users tab there's lnorgaard with default password of Welcome2023!
	trying to ssh in with this gives user flag

	in user home there's RT30000.zip
	scping this back and unzipping gives a .dmp microsoft minidump file (wtf?) and a .kdbx keepass database

	decrypting the database requires a key, apparently extracted from the dump

	running strings on it or trying minidump.py doesn't do shit, but some googling finds this:
		https://github.com/vdohney/keepass-password-dumper

	it gives a bunch of results with broken characters, we don't have the proper font/charset?

	googling any of them finds this:
		https://www.thespruceeats.com/rodgrod-med-flode-danish-red-berry-pudding-2952748

	apparently the broken character is ø

	trying upper/lowercase variations lets us in with password rødgrød med fløde

	apparently root's password is F4><3K0nd!, but we can't ssh with this (it only allows keys?)

	looks like the key is in .ppk (putty) format, using puttygen to convert it to openssh
	puttygen key -O private-openssh -o rootkey

	ssh -i rootkey in, cat /root/root.txt
